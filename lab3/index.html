			<h1>Lab 3 - File stuctures</h1>
			<p>This lab is to further create a local file structure on my computer
				and add index.html files.</p>
			</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I was having trouble trying to figure out how to input images onto my pages. 
					I kept trying input the source of where my photos where located and kept getting a 
						missing message. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I have figured how to sucessfully locate my photos. My orginal photo wasn't 
					working when it was jpg. Yet when I changed it to png, I was able to see my photo.</p>
			       </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I was able to troubleshoot and figure out the problem. The class notes and 
						canvas assignment guide has been a great help. I use them as a guide to see what I have missed 
						or have done wrong.<p>
				

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I have included my index.html file I created:</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<img src="images/file-structure.png" style="width:300px;">
